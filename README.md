# LEDFlash_RasPI
Second Raspberry Pi Zero project I've done. Makes an LED flash on then off when you press a button.

The basic premise, as said up top, is to make an LED turn on, wait for .25 of a second, then turn off (as you'll see in the code). 

For this project, instead of using the RPi.GPIO library for utilising the GPIO, I used the library named gpiozero library, which is a newer/more up to date library with some more beginner-friendly features.

Overall, this was quite an enjoyable venture into how buttons work. As per usual I'll have the link to the diagram, and an image of said diagram below.
